# JosephHookerHTR
XML transcriptions and JPEG images exported from Transkribus for an eScriptorium-Kraken HTR model trained on the correspondence of Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817-1911), primarily letters to William Turner Thiselton-Dyer (1843-1928) during the late-19th/early-20th century. Many transcriptions in this dataset were generated by a small team of anonymous volunteers as part of the Joseph Hooker Correspondence Project based at Kew Gardens. All images in this dataset are reproduced with the kind permission of the Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (Â© RBG, Kew). Contact archives@kew.org for more information.
